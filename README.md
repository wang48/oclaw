## Overview

**Oclaw** is a desktop application for OpenClaw AI agents, based on [ClawX](https://github.com/ValueCell-ai/ClawX) with enhanced features and optimizations.

> **Note**: This project is built upon ClawX, the official desktop interface for OpenClaw. We maintain compatibility with upstream while adding unique features tailored for specific use cases.

---

## What's Different from ClawX

Oclaw extends ClawX with the following enhancements:

### 🎨 **Refined Visual Design**
- Rounded corner icons for a modern, polished look
- Optimized macOS app icon sizing for better system integration
- Enhanced UI consistency across all platforms

### 🛠️ **Dual CLI System**
Two independent command-line interfaces for different purposes:

**`oclaw`** - Application Control CLI
```bash
oclaw status              # Check app status
oclaw provider list       # Manage AI providers
oclaw gateway start       # Control gateway
oclaw skill status        # View skill status
```

**`openclaw`** - OpenClaw Platform CLI
```bash
openclaw gateway start    # Start gateway service
openclaw channels login   # Configure channels
openclaw agent --message  # Interact with agents
```

### 🔧 **Enhanced Developer Experience**
- Improved build scripts and automation
- Better error handling and logging
- Streamlined development workflow

### 🌐 **Localization Improvements**
- Enhanced Chinese language support
- Better multi-language configuration handling

---

## Features

All features from ClawX, plus:

### ✨ Unique to Oclaw

- **Dual CLI Interface**: Separate commands for app control and OpenClaw platform operations
- **Refined Icons**: Modern rounded-corner design across all platforms
- **Enhanced Branding**: Consistent Oclaw branding throughout the application
- **Optimized Build**: Improved packaging and distribution process

### 🎯 Inherited from ClawX

- Zero-configuration setup wizard
- Intelligent chat interface with AI agents
- Multi-channel management (Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, etc.)
- Cron-based task automation
- Extensible skill system with marketplace
- Secure provider integration with system keychain

## Architecture

Oclaw uses a **dual-process architecture**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Electron Main Process             │
│   - Window & lifecycle management   │
│   - Gateway process supervision     │
│   - IPC handlers                    │
│   - CLI mode detection              │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               │ IPC
               ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   React Renderer Process            │
│   - UI components (React 19)        │
│   - State management (Zustand)      │
│   - WebSocket client                │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               │ WebSocket (JSON-RPC)
               ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   OpenClaw Gateway (Child Process)  │
│   - AI agent runtime                │
│   - Channel management              │
│   - Skill execution                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Relationship with ClawX

Oclaw is a **fork** of ClawX with the following relationship:

- **Upstream**: [ClawX](https://github.com/ValueCell-ai/ClawX) - Official OpenClaw desktop interface
- **Downstream**: Oclaw - Enhanced version with additional features

We periodically merge upstream changes from ClawX to stay current with the latest OpenClaw features and improvements.

### When to Use Oclaw vs ClawX

**Use Oclaw if you want:**
- Dual CLI system for both app control and OpenClaw operations
- Refined visual design with rounded icons
- Enhanced Chinese localization
- Specific customizations and optimizations

**Use ClawX if you want:**
- Official release from the OpenClaw team
- Standard feature set without modifications
- Direct upstream support
